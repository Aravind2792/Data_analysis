# Flight Data Exploration

## Dataset

The flights dataset have been used in this project which will be explored using many level of visualisation. This data reports
Aggregated version of data has been used which is obtained from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp and it contains details of the arrival points of flights in the United States, including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays, from 1987 to 2008.


## Summary of Findings

1.From analysing the Carrier's performance, SouthWest Airlines has recorded the worst figures in terms of delay, the SouthWeat airlines puts up a pretty interesting case. They have been the worst managed carrier in terms of delay across the years but also they have also been the most favoured carrier service. While Allegiant airline stands the least favoured flight with least delays.

2.From the weather delay analysis, Atlanta and Dallas has recorded most the delayed airport by weather as it is susceptible to cyclones/hurricanes. While Chicago comes third which is prone to extreme snowfalls during winter.And as expected the weather delays have been maximum on June and Decemeber which is when the Rainy and winter seasons would be at peak,but the frequency of the flight operated is also high during these seasons as it could relate to Hoilday seasons.

3.For the general analysis of delays, Late aircraft delays contributes more National Aviation System delays which gives an idea of the operational efficieny of Aircrafts and Airports.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on 3 factors:
1. influence of delays to Airlines which is one of the Performance measure for a Airline service.
2. Next I explored on the weather delays to which the Airline have been subjected across the years.
3. My third focus was the analysing the Delay trends, like the contributing factors for NAS delays and the proportion of delays acroos the years.
